An API for loading and using configuration files, see <a href="https://github.com/typesafehub/config/">the project site</a>
for more information.
</p>

<p>
    Typically you would load configuration with a static method from {@link
    org.deephacks.confit.internal.core.runtime.typesafe.ConfigFactory} and then use
    it with methods in the {@link org.deephacks.confit.internal.core.runtimtypesafeig.Config} interface.
</p>

<p>
    An application can simply call {@link
    org.deephacks.confit.internal.core.runtime.typesafe.ConfigFactory#load()} and place
    its configuration in &amp;amp;amp;quot;application.conf&amp;amp;amp;quot; on the classpath.
    If you use the default configuration from {@link
    org.deephacks.confit.internal.cortypesafeime.config.ConfigFactory#load()}
    there&amp;amp;amp;apos;s no need to pass a configuration to your libraries
    and frameworks, as long as they all default to this same default, which they should.
</p>

<p>
A library or framework should ship a file "reference.conf" in its jar, and allow an application to pass in a
{@link org.deephacks.confit.internal.core.runtime.typesafe.Config} to be used for the library. If no {@link org.deephacks.confit.internal.core.runtime.typesafe.Config} is provided,
call {@link org.deephacks.confit.internal.core.runtime.typesafe.ConfigFactory#load()}
to get the default one. Typically a library might offer two constructors, one with a <code>Config</code> parameter
and one which uses {@link org.deephacks.confit.internal.core.runtime.typesafe.ConfigFactory#load()}.
</p>

You can find an example app and library <a href="https://github.com/typesafehub/config/tree/master/examples">on GitHub</a>.
